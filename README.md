<h1>Binary Classification Neural Network</h1>
This is a simple neural network that uses PyTorch and NumPy to train a binary classification model using the sigmoid activation function. The network has an input layer with 2 neurons, a hidden layer with 4 neurons, and an output layer with 1 neuron. The network is trained using gradient descent with a fixed learning rate over a specified number of epochs.

<h3>Usage</h3>
To use the network, simply run the provided Python code in an environment with PyTorch and NumPy installed. The code defines the input data X and target output y, which are used to train the network. The network is trained using gradient descent with a fixed learning rate and number of epochs, and the loss is plotted over time to help visualize how well the network is learning.

After training, the network is used to make predictions on new data by passing the input data through the network and applying the sigmoid activation function to the output of each neuron. The final predictions are outputted to the console.

<h3>Dependencies</h3>
Python 3.x
PyTorch
NumPy
Matplotlib
